An upstream patch fixed this long ago (https://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_native/commit/a8f0f242299d620caa292dc2312f77bcf1d90f4b) and that was noted on both the 14.1 and 15.1 submissions of this patch.",

      "message": "Kind of. That commit was the one that AOSP had when the 14.1 and 15.1 patches were abandoned. The code has been changed since then, because of https://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_native/commit/8af03060a9ee64c48ac8342be8775f7d54f9ec20 -- however that was the patch that fixed the issue. Either way, the 18.1 and 19.0 ports both have the commit I just linked, so the function returns right before this null check.",
