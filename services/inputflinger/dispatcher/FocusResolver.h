//   Focus request - Request will be granted if the window is focusable. If it's not
//   focusable, then the request is persisted and granted when it becomes focusable. The currently
//   focused window will lose focus and any pending keys will be added to a queue so it can be sent
//   to the window when it gets focus.
//
//   Condition focus request - Request with a focus token specified. Request will be granted if the
//   window is focusable and the focus token is the currently focused. Otherwise, the request is
//   dropped. Conditional focus requests are not persisted. The window will lose focus and go back
//   to the focus token if it becomes not focusable.
//
//   Window handle updates - Focus is lost when the currently focused window becomes not focusable.
//   If the previous focus request is focusable, then we will try to grant that window focus.
