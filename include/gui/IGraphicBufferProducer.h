/*
 * This class defines the Binder IPC interface for the producer side of
 * a queue of graphics buffers.  It's used to send graphics data from one
 * component to another.  For example, a class that decodes video for
 * playback might use this to provide frames.  This is typically done
 * indirectly, through Surface.
 *
 * The underlying mechanism is a BufferQueue, which implements
 * BnGraphicBufferProducer.  In normal operation, the producer calls
 * dequeueBuffer() to get an empty buffer, fills it with data, then
 * calls queueBuffer() to make it available to the consumer.
 *
 * This class was previously called ISurfaceTexture.
