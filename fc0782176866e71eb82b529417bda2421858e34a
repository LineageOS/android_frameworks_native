      "message": "Disabling the device causes it to not show in apps looking for all input devices. A good example is steam link--the single joycons and combined controller would both show as options, but they would have issues. some other apps wouldn\u0027t even ask, and would auto select an incorrect device. I could swap to deleting the device, but the concern was if we wanted to re enable the device later on (our Daemon will soon expose a userspace toggle to re-enable the single cons and disable combined).",
